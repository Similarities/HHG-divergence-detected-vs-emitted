# HHG-divergence-detected-vs-emitted
geometrics HHG divergence detected vs full emitted cone

High Harmonics divergence follow the laser divergence divided by the harmonic number.
In other words 1/N dependency. At a detector we find at a certain distance a fixed collection angle 
that is determined by the spectrometer geometry. For 1/N incoming divergence the collection angle
might be smaller than the full harmonic beam divergence up to certain harmonic number N.
From this number the code sets the relative fraction collected from the emitted beam area at the
grating to 1, in the other cases the fraction is calculated.
